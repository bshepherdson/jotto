# Jotto

This is an implementation of the word and logic game Jotto by Braden Shepherdson. It is written in Javascript using Node.js on the server, AngularJS on the client, and Socket.io for communication. It is released under the BSD3 license.

This project was intended as a quick learning project for me to develop effective techniques for using AngularJS, and to a lesser extent Node. I'm pleased with the results and will be continuing with a larger project.
